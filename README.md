Predict whether a customer will subscribe to a bank term deposit using demographic and campaign features, based on the UCI Bank Marketing dataset.

## Project Overview
- Binary classification task: `y` = term deposit subscription (`yes` / `no`)
- Built interpretable Decision Tree models and improved performance using boosting
- Focused on appropriate evaluation metrics due to class imbalance

## Dataset
- UCI Machine Learning Repository — Bank Marketing
- Data from direct marketing (phone call) campaigns of a Portuguese bank

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and encoding
- Decision Tree classifier (baseline)
- Boosting model(s)
- Model evaluation using precision, recall, F1, and confusion matrices
